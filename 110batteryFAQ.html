        <tr><td>
            <h3>1. Speech settings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>System - no change</li>
                <p>
                The application will use Android system speech settings (engine, language, voice, speed, pitch),
                <br/>often called "text to speech" or TTS for short, available in each version of Android system.
                <br/>The localization depends on the Android version and manufacturer, check for example:
                <br/>Settings -> General management -> Text-to-speech
                <br/>Settings -> System -> Language & input -> Text-to-speech output
                </p>

                <li>Application - (language)</li>
                <p>
                When you select this option, which is selected by default,
                the application will use the system text to speech engine,
                <br/>but will also try to set the voice language to the same language as the application interface.
                </p>

                <li>Enter custom</li>
                <p>
                To customize own speech settings independent from system, choose this option,
                <br/>and customize own parameters (engine, language, voice, speed, pitch)
                directly in application.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Additional speech engines</h3>
            <p>
            Most android devices have pre-installed speech engines.
            The most common are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tts">Google Speech Recognition and Synthesis</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.SMT?langCd=en">Samsung text-to-speech engine</a></li>
            </ul>

            <br/>You can install additional speech engines and voices of your choice.
            <br/>Some voices may require additional payment. You can try for example:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.codefactory.vocalizertts">Vocalizer TTS</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acapelagroup.android.tts">Acapela TTS Voices</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android">RHVoice</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intu.multilingualtts">Multilingual TTS</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>3. Battery charge status 100% versus full</h3>
            <p>
                When you charge your device and it reaches 100% load,
                <br/>you can see that it will still be in charging state,
                and you will still see significant charging current (when the device supports).

                <br/>Battery full charge status is when the device finishes charging the battery,
                you should not see any charging current
                <br/>and the device starts drawing power directly from the charger.

                <br/>Keep in mind that it may take some time to reach this state
                and requires the right cable and charger.
                <br/>We noticed that some devices never reach this state,
                and some with a long delay.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Presenting charging current</h3>
            <p>
                Not every device shows the correct charging current.
                <br/>A minus sign (-) before the current should appear during discharging,
                the absence of the sign means charging, the battery is gaining energy.
                <br/>It should be noted that some devices can have the opposite logic.
                <br/>It is also possible that some weak chargers or USB are not able to provide enough power,
                <br/>so you may see that the device is losing power even when connected to the charger.
                <br/>Just try using a different cable or a charger with higher power.
            </p>
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td>
            <h3>5. Background activity</h3>
            <p>
                Remember that every application in the background uses some power.

                <br/>Every android device has battery saving procedures,
                that are designed to save battery power.
                <br/>The system may try to stop some apps from running in the background,
                especially when the device is disconnected from the charger.
                <br/>To avoid this behaviour, check the various system app settings, for example:
                <br/>"Allow background activity"
                <br/>"Ignore battery optimization"
                <br/>"Remove from optimized applications"
            </p>
            <p>
                <br/>If you only need the application as a charging assistant,
                you can manually close the application once it's done charging.
                <br/>Use the cross in upper right corner to completely close the application,
                <br/>along with the notification.
            </p>
