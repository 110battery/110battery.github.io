        <tr><td>
            <h3>1. Speech settings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>System - no change
                    <p>The application will use Android system speech settings (engine, language, voice, speed, pitch),
                    <br/>often called "text to speech" or TTS for short, available in each version of Android system.
                    <br/>The localization depends on the Android version and manufacturer, check for example:
                    <br/>Settings -> General management -> Text-to-speech
                    <br/>Settings -> System -> Language & input -> Text-to-speech output
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Application - (language)
                    <p>When you select this option, which is selected by default,
                    the application will use the system text to speech engine,
                    <br/>but will also try to set the voice language to the same language as the application interface.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Enter custom
                    <p>To customize own speech settings independent from system, choose this option,
                    <br/>and customize own parameters (engine, language, voice, speed, pitch)
                    directly in application.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>
            <h3>2. Additional speech engines</h3>
            <p>Most android devices have pre-installed speech engines.
            </p>
            The most common are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tts">Google Speech Recognition and Synthesis</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.SMT?langCd=en">Samsung text-to-speech engine</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can install additional speech engines and voices of your choice.
            </p>
            Some voices may require additional payment. You can try for example:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.codefactory.vocalizertts">Vocalizer TTS</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acapelagroup.android.tts">Acapela TTS Voices</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android">RHVoice</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intu.multilingualtts">Multilingual TTS</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Voice notifications about battery health, charging level, connected charger.</h3>
            <p>The latest version adds the ability to change the interval between voice notifications for charging level and temperature.
                <br/>Previously, the app repeated the battery level in 1% increments at a predefined interval,
                which could be too frequent on fast chargers.
                <br/>Now you can modify this interval yourself. By default, it's set between 5-20% depending on the level,
                but you can set it to 1%, as in previous versions of the app, or any other value you prefer.
            </p>
            <p>Preferences - section <b>Alarms/notifications with sound/voice</b>
                <br/>The app notifies you with a voice prompt when changes occur or when events such as device unlocking or time change.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Switch <b>Notify on changes in health, charging, charger</b>
                <p>You'll hear a voice message when a parameter changes,
                e.g., health status changes, charger connection, charge level changes,
                or temperature exceeds a certain limit.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Switch <b>Notify on unlock button</b>
                <p>After unlocking the device, you'll hear a full voice message about its health status,
                connected charger, and detailed charge level.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Switch <b>Notify on time</b>
                <p>You will hear a full voice message at regular intervals, similar to the one for unlocking.
                </p>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Battery charge status 100% versus full</h3>
            <p>When you charge your device and it reaches 100% load,
                <br/>you can see that it will still be in charging state,
                and you will still see significant charging current (when the device supports).
                <br/>Battery full charge status is when the device finishes charging the battery,
                you should not see any charging current
                <br/>and the device starts drawing power directly from the charger.
                <br/>Keep in mind that it may take some time to reach this state
                and requires the right cable and charger.
                <br/>We noticed that some devices never reach this state,
                and some with a long delay.
            </p>

        <tr><td>
            <h3>5. Presenting charging current</h3>
            <p>Not every device shows the correct charging current.
                <br/>A minus sign (-) before the current should appear during discharging,
                the absence of the sign means charging, the battery is gaining energy.
                <br/>It should be noted that some devices can have the opposite logic.
                <br/>It is also possible that some weak chargers or USB are not able to provide enough power,
                <br/>so you may see that the device is losing power even when connected to the charger.
                <br/>Just try using a different cable or a charger with higher power.
            </p>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td>
            <h3>6. Background activity</h3>
            <p>Remember that every application in the background uses some power.
                <br/>Every android device has battery saving procedures,
                that are designed to save battery power.
                <br/>The system may try to stop some apps from running in the background,
                especially when the device is disconnected from the charger.
                <br/>To avoid this behaviour, check the various system app settings, for example:
                <br/>"Allow background activity"
                <br/>"Ignore battery optimization"
                <br/>"Remove from optimized applications"
            </p>
            <p>If you only need the application as a charging assistant,
                you can manually close the application once it's done charging.
                <br/>Use the cross in upper right corner to completely close the application,
                along with the notification.
            </p>
            <p>Preferences - section <b>Background activity</b>
                <br/>This section controls various parameters of the app's background operation.
                <br/>The app enters background mode when it's not visible on the screen, for example, after launching another app or locking the phone.
                While running in the background, the app displays important information in the form of system notifications.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Switch <b>Automatically mute when device sound is turned off</b>
                <p>The app responds to device muting, for example, by turning off the sound directly or by activating "Do Not Disturb" mode.
                If the app is not visible, the app's sound will be muted, and the app will stop speaking.
                <br/>This option is very convenient, for example, when going to sleep or in a meeting.
                We don't have to search for the app and turn off the sound directly in the app.
                The app will respond to the device's sound being turned off.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Switch <b>Show system notifications</b>
                <p>This option displays system notifications with basic app information (charge level, health, battery temperature).
                <br/>You cannot disable this option if you want the app to run in the background.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Switch <b>Run background service</b>
                <p>The app will run as a background service.
                <br/>For advanced users, you can check the background services in your phone's developer options.
                You can find instructions on how to enable developer settings in your phone's documentation or search the internet or YouTube.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Switch <b>Automatic start after device restart</b>
                <p>The app will automatically restart after your phone restarts.
                <br/>Due to background app restrictions, automatic restart may not work on newer Android versions,
                such as 15 (VanillaIceCream) and 16 (Baklava).
                </p>
